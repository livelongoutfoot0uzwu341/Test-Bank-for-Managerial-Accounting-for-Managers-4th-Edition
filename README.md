  * Managerial Accounting for Managers, 4th edition by Noreen/Brewer/Garrison is based on the market-leading managerial accounting solution, Managerial Accounting, by Garrison, Noreen and Brewer. The Noreen solution presents integrated and proven solutions designed to help attain course goals of student readiness, comprehension of content, and application of key concepts in the managerial accounting course, while addressing the needs of instructors who do not wish to teach the financial accounting-oriented content that is included in the Garrison solution (no debits/credits). Of the three programs in the Garrison franchise (the Brewer solution, the Garrison solution, and the Noreen solution), the Noreen solution is the most pure management accounting content. The other two programs contain greater coverage of financial accounting topics.
